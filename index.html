<p>Hi, I'm a Ph.D. candidate in social sciences (political science) at <span style="font-size:18px;color:orange;">California Institute of Technology</span>. Previously, I obtained my MSc in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics with <i>Distinction</i> from <b>London School of Economics and Political Science</b> in July 2015. You can find my curriculum vitae <a href="https://www.its.caltech.edu/~yli2/CV_YL.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>My research interests are in <b>American Politics</b> and <b>Political Methodology</b>, focusing on media, elections and election administration, and political behavior and public opinion.</p>
<p>To study substantive questions in these areas, I develop new quantitative methods and improve upon existing methods, including text analysis tools, survey methods, and causal inference. My work involves designing and implementing large-scale online surveys, as well as analyzing large datasets such as corpora of news articles and voter registration data from states and counties.</p>
<p>You can find my publications and ongoing projects <a href="https://yimeng-li.com/all_research/">here</a>.</p>
