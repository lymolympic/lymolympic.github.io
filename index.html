<p>Hi, I'm a Postdoctoral Scholar at <b>Florida State University</b>. Previously, I obtained my PhD in Social Sciences from <b style="font-size:18px;color:orange;">California Institute of Technology</b> and my MSc in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics with <i>Distinction</i> from <b>London School of Economics and Political Science</b>.
<p>I work primarily on <b>Elections</b> and <b>Political Methodology</b>. My recent substantive works focus on the causal effects of various election reforms. My recent methodological works focus on survey methods (sensitive questions, attention checks, and open-ended questions) and text analysis.</p>
<p>My work involves designing and implementing large-scale online surveys, as well as analyzing large datasets such as corpora of news articles and voter registration data from states and counties. You can find my publications and working papers <a href="https://yimeng-li.com/all_research/">here</a>.</p>
