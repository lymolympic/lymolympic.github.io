<p>Hi, I'm a Ph.D. candidate in social sciences (political science) at <span style="font-size:18px;color:orange;">California Institute of Technology</span>. Previously, I obtained my MSc in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics with <i>Distinction</i> from <b>London School of Economics and Political Science</b> in July 2015. You can find my curriculum vitae <a href="https://www.its.caltech.edu/~yli2/CV_YL_Feb2022.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>I work on <b>Political Methodology</b>, and substantively on <b>media</b>, <b>elections and election administration</b>, and <b>political behavior</b> and <b>public opinion</b>.</p>
<p>To study substantive questions in these areas, I develop new quantitative methods and improve upon existing methods, including text analysis tools, survey methods, and causal inference. My work involves designing and implementing large-scale online surveys, as well as analyzing large datasets such as corpora of news articles and voter registration data from states and counties. You can find my publications and ongoing projects <a href="https://yimeng-li.com/all_research/">here</a>.</p>
