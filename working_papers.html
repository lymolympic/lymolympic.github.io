          Universal Mail Ballot Delivery Boosts Turnout: The Causal Effects of Sending Mail Ballots to All Registered Voters
        </a>

        <div id="abstract1" class="abstract">
          Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, some American states had transitioned to universal voting-by-mail, where all registered voters receive a mail ballot.  But due to the pandemic, in 2020 universal voting-by-mail was suddenly used in a larger number of states.  Here we study a unique situation in which registered voters in some legislative districts in Los Angeles County were subjected to universal voting-by-mail in the March 2020 primary.  Using difference-in-difference and regression discontinuity designs on individual-level records, we use this within-jurisdiction situation to estimate the causal effects of universal voting-by-mail on voter turnout and on who votes.   Our results indicate that voter turnout increased by around 3% for voters who do not automatically receive a mail ballot, and the increase is larger for registered partisan voters than those without a party affiliation.
